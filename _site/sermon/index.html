  <h3>
    Marriage is a reflection of what it means to join ourselves with Christ.
    Scripture Reading: Eph 5:22-28
  </h3>

  <p>
    婚姻代表了我们与基督同在的意义
  </p>
  <p>
    We are all gathered to celebrate the joy of 2 persons making a lifelong commitment to each other as H & W. On this wedding day, the happiest person in this room is e Bride & e Bridegroom & their parents & relatives too. So we r here to share their joy.
  </p>

  <p>
    今天我们聚集在一起，是为了祝贺这对新人终成眷属。在这个婚礼的殿堂里，最幸福的人是新娘和新郎和他们的父母。我们所有的亲朋好友，今天到来是为例祝福，分享这份喜乐的请举手！谢谢！
  </p>

  <p>
    Some couples before their wedding, we know they are heading for some serious trouble because they have not address e issues tt every couple will faced when they live together. Every want perfection … a perfect wedding, a perfect spouse, a perfect home & perfect children. On this side of heaven ere is no perfection.., nothing on earth is perfect.
  </p>

  <p>
    有一些新婚夫妇在婚礼前，我们就知道他们正在走向一条很麻烦的路，因为他们没有解决每对夫妇即将面对的问题，他们希望有一个完美的婚礼，完美的配偶，完美的家庭和完美的孩子。 很可惜，在天堂的这一边是没有完美的，在地球上没有什么是完美的。有一些新婚夫妇在婚礼前，我们就知道他们正在走向一条很麻烦的路，因为他们没有解决每对夫妇即将面对的问题，他们希望有一个完美的婚礼，完美的配偶，完美的家庭和完美的孩子。 很可惜，在天堂的这一边是没有完美的，在地球上没有什么是完美的。
  </p>

  <p>
    For Jason & Winnie, they will start their new lives together on a strong foundation because they have been thru 6 months PMC course. They have discovered their opposites, they address financial issues, they have learn how to quarrel productively, they have dealt with their own character flaws & they have shared their dreams, passions & weaknesses w each other. Every have discovered who their marriage spouse is so that they won’t get a shock after marriage.
  </p>

  <p>
    对于Jason＆Winnie来说，他们的新生活是建立在一个坚实的基础上，因为他们已经上了6个月的婚前辅导课程。 他们发现了彼此的不同点，他们学会解决财务问题，他们学会如何有效地吵架，他们也学习看到自己的性格缺陷，同时分享了彼此的梦想，激情和弱点等等。 他们认真的认识对方，可以减少婚后的冲击。
  </p>

  <p>
    But more importantly, they have made a commitment to one another today to live for each other the rest of their earthly lives. They are committed to work at their marriage life from here on till Jesus comes or till they go on to glory in heaven.
  </p>

  <p>
    但是最重要的是，他们今天将对彼此承诺，在有生之年，相互扶持直到耶稣再来，将荣耀归于上帝。
  </p>

  <p>
    Every vows they took before God today is so vital to their marriage life because it is binding upon them for the rest of their lives & when they look back to this day, everyone will remember their vows.
  </p>

  <p>
    他们今天在神面前所许下的每一个承诺和誓言对于他们的婚姻生活来说是至关重要的，因为它在他们的生命中有约束力。当他们回想起这一天时，每个人都会记得他们取下的誓言。
  </p>

  <p>
    When times are tough, when there is conflict, they will remember this vows they made today & say I have made a commitment to him so I am going to stick with it & work it out, no matter what, no matter how I feels, no matter how she looks or looks at me, no matter the pressures I face at work or with e finances, I am going to stick with her through thick and thin.
  </p>

  <p>
    当他们在面对困难时，在冲突时，他们会牢记他们今天所作的承诺，无论我的感觉怎样， 无论对方怎样看我，无论在工作或财务面对什么压力，我都会坚持到底
  </p>

  <p>
    Eg. So as the years roll by and time takes their toll on them physically and they become old and gray, they will still be committed to each other. When JT becomes wrinkled & bald – W will still be committed to him. When W becomes weak & bent JT will still be committed to her.
  </p>

  <p>
    例如。 随着时间的老去，不管JT会不会变成秃头像牧师一样，不管W会不会变成驼背，依然守着这份承诺和誓言
  </p>

  <p>
    This is what the vows and commitment to each other they make to each other means.
  </p>

  <p>
    这就是他们彼此许下承诺和誓言的意义。
  </p>

  <p>
    But Marriage is a reflection of what it means when we joined ourselves to Jesus.
  </p>

  <p>
    婚姻也是我们加入基督教和耶稣在一起的倒影。
  </p>

  <p>
    The joys, love & commitment that surrounding this occasion today is a reflection of what a person experienced when he/she becomes a Christian.
  </p>

  <p>
    在爱的承诺底下享受的欢乐，也是当一个人成为基督徒，在神的爱里头时可以感受到的喜乐。
  </p>

  <p>
    Everyone who is truly born again experience e joy & love that comes from Jesus because  our sins are forgiven & we can begin a new life with God as our loving heavenly father. No longer condemned for all the things that we have done wrong but forgiven and loved by the God who made the universe and have shown proof that He loves us.
  </p>

  <p>
    当我们在耶稣基督的爱里，得到重生，罪得到赦免，我们不必再背负着谴责，我们做过的错误，可以得到赦免。因为他是创造宇宙的神，每一个经历来自耶稣的爱的人，可以开始重新开始，因为神爱世人，他已经先证明了他的爱。
  </p>

  <p>
    We read that wives are to submit to their husbands as & husbands are to love their wives. The debate is always who is supposed to make the 1st move.  Is it the Wife or the Husband? All the Wife will argue that is the Husband. & all the Husband will argue that is the Wife.
  </p>

  <p>
    我们读到圣经说，妻子要服从丈夫，丈夫要爱他们的妻子。 我们常常辩论，谁该做第一步。 是妻子还是丈夫？ 所有的妻子都会认为应该丈夫先开始。 所有的丈夫争辩，应该妻子先服从。
  </p>

  <p>
    This problem arise because we are reading what the bible says to the other party... we should read what the bible says to us not to the other party. So the Husband only read the Husband part & not the Wife part & the Wife only read the Wife part not the Husband part.
  </p>

  <p>
    问题出现了，因为我们都在读圣经对对方说的话......我们应该读圣经对我们而不是向对方说的话。 所以丈夫只需要读丈夫的部分，而不是妻子部分和妻子只读妻子部分而不是丈夫的部分。
  </p>

  <p>
    If we stop looking at the small dust in our spouse eye & instead address the big log of wood in our own eye is what will make a happy marriage.
  </p>

  <p>
    如果我们停止看着配偶眼中的灰尘，而是先处理自己的眼睛里的沙粒，我们将走向一个幸福的婚姻。
  </p>

  <p>
    So don’t worry about what the other party is meant to do. Just do your part 1st & be concerned about your part, don’t focus on what e other party should do or should not do. Get your act in order 1st . The wife submits to the husband because she loves Jesus.
  </p>

  <p>
    所以，不要担心对方打算做什么。 只要关心你应该做什么或不应该做什么。 妻子服从丈夫，因为你爱耶稣。
  </p>

  <p>
    Whatever we do for Jesus, we will have great joy. Our heavenly bridegroom is Jesus & He loves the bride unconditionally & sacrificially. The Bride is the people who formed a community to carry out Jesus’ agenda to demonstrate His love and power.
  </p>

  <p>
    无论我们为耶稣做什么，我们都将得到很大的喜乐。 我们天上的新郎是耶稣，他无条件地爱我们。 我们作为基督徒就是要把神的爱和力量传达给每一个我们身边的人。请你给你旁边的人一个最好的微笑！
  </p>

  <p>
    Love is a commitment & no matter what we have made of ourselves & no matter how dirty, slimy, vile, horrible we are, our heavenly bridegroom Jesus still loves us.
  </p>

  <p>
    爱是一种承诺，不管我们做了什么，不管多么脏，多么可怕，我们天上的新郎-耶稣仍然爱我们。
  </p>

  <p>
    Ere is no place we can be that Jesus’s love can’t reach him. Jesus’s love will reach the deepest pit of sin that we have landed in & pull us out of that terrible place.
  </p>

  <p>
    世界上没有一个地方，耶稣的爱不能传达。耶稣的爱可以抵达最深的坑，把我们从可怕的地方拉出来。
  </p>

  <p>
    Friend if you are here today & you have not experience that kind of joy & devoted love, then you should turn to Jesus to experience His forgiveness and love
  </p>

  <p>
    朋友，你今天在这里不是偶然的，如果你没有体验到这种喜悦和奉献的爱，希望你能体验耶稣的爱和饶恕
  </p>

  <p>
    You won't be sorry for turning to Jesus…because He is waiting for you with His open arms. Don’t wait any longer because you are coming to the One who will make rivers of refreshing life giving water flow out from u. U are coming to e One who lights up heaven with His presence. you are coming to the One who is called the Good Shepherd & when u to follow JC, He will lead u besides still waters & green pastures & He will restore your souls.
  </p>

  <p>
    你不会因为相信耶稣而感到遗憾，他正在张开的手臂等着你。 一个能点亮你的生命，让生命的水从你身上源源不绝的流出。 然你看到天堂的曙光。因为耶稣是好的牧羊人，当你跟随主耶稣，他会带领你到有水和绿色的牧场，然你的灵魂得到喜悦和平安。
  </p>

  <p>
    So let me encourage you to come to Jesus today. You are already in His house & amongst His people. Everyone that belongs to Jesus will welcome you and even all the angels in heaven will rejoice with dancing and singing because you came to Jesus to have your sins forgiven and begin your new life with Jesus.
  </p>

  <p>
    所以，让我鼓励你今天来到耶稣面前。 你已经在他的家和他的子民之中。 每个属于耶稣的人都会欢迎你，甚至天上的天使都会因为你来到耶稣面前，唱歌跳舞，因为你的罪得到赦免，可以有新的开始。
  </p>

  <p>
    Now turning back to the marriage, the strength and joys of marriage depends on e killing our ego...
  </p>

  <p>
    现在回到这个婚礼，要得到婚姻的快乐和力量，首先要放弃我们的自我...
  </p>

  <p>
    When our ego rules over us, e marriage is in for 1 rough & rocking ride because our ego makes us proud and selfish and insecure and self serving. But when e couple decides to puts down their ego & humble themselves before God & each other, they will have a loving & fulfilling married life.
  </p>

  <p>
    强烈的自我会使我们自大和自私，没有安全感。所以 当我们决定放下自己，在上帝面前彼此谦虚，就会有一颗充满爱的心和充实的婚姻生活。
  </p>

  <p>
    Today, everyone who witness this wedding rejoice w JT & W & wished for them to have a fulfilling married life and the way there is to encourage them to put down their own pride and ego
  </p>

  <p>
    今天，在座的每个人见证了这场婚礼的欢乐，我们衷心的希望JT＆W能有一个充实的婚姻生活方式，鼓励他们放下自我
  </p>

  <p>
    I remember when JT 1st came to my house as a young 20 year old skinny guy & he is still skinny & W as a young girl who has tremendous talent & little personality of her own. But I saw them growing up & maturing through the difficulties they face in life. They may have taken different routes to maturity but today onwards they decide to go on e same journey & what a blessed ride it would be for both of them.
  </p>

  <p>
    牧师记得当JT第一次来到他的家，一个20岁年轻的瘦伙子，他现在还是很瘦。W一个年轻的女孩，有着巨大的天赋和个性。 我看到他们的成长和成熟，也经历了生活中的困难。 他们可能采取不同的路线，但今天，他们决定一起去开启一个共同的旅程，这是一件多么令人高兴的事。
  </p>

  <p>
    JT & W have known each other for a long time and when J decided to take a long and hard look at W, he found what a precious jewel W is – humble, unassuming, gentle and kind woman she is. W look at J & saw a sincere, genuine caring man with such great potential who would go the 2nd, 3rd & even 4th mile to help others.
  </p>

  <p>
    JT＆W已经认识了很长时间，当J决定仔细地观察W时，他发现一颗珍贵的宝石，W是一个谦逊有礼，温柔和善良的女人。 W仔细地观察J，发现他是一个真诚，有爱心的人，他不介意走第二，第三，甚至第四英里去帮助别人。
  </p>


<p>
  And so their love for each other blossoms…and on the 13th Feb early this yr, Jason decided to ask W to marry him at my house & what a wonderful occasion was that.
</p>

<p>
  他们对彼此的爱开花...在今年的2月13日，Jason决定在我家的游泳池，在大家的见证下向W求婚，这是一件多么美好的时刻。
</p>

<p>
  But because they 1st found Jesus & before they found each other and because they decided to give their lives to JC before they give their lives to each another, they will have a wonderful marriage life when they let JC rule over their lives.
</p>

<p>
  因为他们在彼此找到彼此之前找到了耶稣，因为他们将他们的一切交给耶稣，让耶稣为他们做主，所以我相信他们会有一个美好的婚姻生活。
</p>

<p>
  their lives have changed tremendously as they give themselves to JC. They found peace, they had their sins forgiven, they started their new life when they became Christian & they would want all of us here to have e same joy that they found in JC.
</p>

<p>
  他们将自己交给耶稣， 成为基督教，他们找到了平安，他们的罪得到赦免，他们也希望我们所有的人都能在基督的爱里得到同样的喜乐。
</p>

<p>
  They want you also to have the same peace, joy & love that they have found in Jesus …God has rose Jesus from the dead, so that everyone who wants can have a new life. This miracle of new life can b yours too because of JC. So today start your new life.. just as JT & W will start their new life today as Husband & Wife…
</p>

<p>
  他们也希望你也有同样的平安，喜乐和爱，他们在耶稣里找到了......上帝已经使耶稣从死里复活，让每个相信的人都能有一个新的生命。 今天就开始新的生活..JT＆W作为丈夫和妻子，今天也将开始他们新的生活...

</p>

<p>
  Every will enter into a new phrase of their life that is build on friendship, giving & care. This new phrase of life as Husband & Wife will mature them & enrich their lives. Everyone have matured emotionally & spiritually & now they will grow together as 1… just as e bible taught us man shall live father & mom & cleave to his wife & e 2 shall become 1 flesh… 1 in unity in both body & soul.
</p>

<p>
  每一个人在人生的不同阶段，都会开始新的生活。作为丈夫和妻子是人生的新里程碑，新的生活方式将使他们更成熟，和一起成长。如圣经教导我们，我们将离开父母和妻子二合为一，在身体和灵魂上的结合在一起。
</p>

<p>
  So let us pray for them as they start this journey. We will now have a time of prayer for e Bride & groom & we ask J & W to come forward. I would also like to invite leaders of the church to come forward & prayer for them.
</p>

<p>
  让我们为他们即将开展这个重大的人生旅程祷告和祝福。 我们现在邀请这对新郎新娘上前来，为他们祷告。邀请教会的领导们为他们祷告，也请大家伸出双手为他们祝福。
